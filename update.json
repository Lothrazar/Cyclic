Sack of holding now always drops the full sack on the player going both ways (instead of sometimes where the chest was, and sometimes where the player is).  Add error handing to Ender Shears to avoid ticking entity crashes, and make sure Ender Shears drops as an item when it hits a block, or a sheep that has already been sheared, or any non-sheep entity.  "
  	,"1.7.15":"Compatibility: fix Magic Bean not getting harvested by Pams Harvestcraft right-click auto-harvest feature.  Make sure Magic Bean always drops its seed when broken, fully grown or not.  Magic bean now respects drops two random items by default if broken, and respects fortune on tools.  Add a bit Magic Bean loot such as stained glass and hardened clay, a few other things (this helps dilute the really good stuff ... it still currently drops vanilla items only)."
  	,"1.7.16":"Fix potion upgrade recipes not working (ingredients changed to changed to gold & ink sacs instead of redstone/glowstone as workaround for known& reported bug in forge).  Added Hit Deposit mode to storage sack: Hit on a block to change modes, and hit on a container to deposit (if you have enabled it).  Add smelting recipes for End & Nether ores by request in case you silk touch them.  Removed key modifiers from default keybindings, (since in current forge version, the modifier cannot be removed: if you rebind to a single key, and restart,  the modifier from the default gets put back on your new key).  Fix keybindings for Extended Inventory and Inventory Crafting not closing the screens when open.  Add chat message to ender dungeon finder if no spawners are in range.  Fix Ender Book crashing servers when players used it and didn't have enough experience points."
  	,"1.7.17":"Machines with inventory now output comparator signals based on contents just like chests (affects Uncrafting Grinder, Controlled Miner, Block Placer, Structure Builder)"
  	,"1.7.18":"Fix helper buttons crashing when trying to deposit on invalid containers (such as Password Trigger).  Fix duplication bug with some some blocks (such as Quantum Storage Unit) when using Sack of Holding.  "
  	,"1.7.19":"Fix duplication bug on Storage Sack with Quantum Storage blocks again (update to build 1.7.18)"
  	,"1.7.20":"Fix Stack of Storage displaying the Items Deposited: message even when no items were moved.  Make sure identical item stacks get merged if possible when using Dump mode.

  	,"1.7.21":"New Machine: Automated User (automated item use / right click).  Tweak tooltips on a few other machines.  "
 	,"1.7.22":"Fix Auto Fisher sometimes crashing when unloading chunks (and getting a null loot table).  Avoid ConcurrentModificationException crashes when using exchange scepters or the piston wand (now uses minecraft's vanilla built in addScheduledTask to avoid modifying server data asynchronously).  Also for these scepters increase cooldown from 8 ticks to 10.  Sack of holding now works with more stuff (for example, the machines from Extra Utilities 2).  Change default value of TerrariaInventoryButtons to false (it has caused issues with several other mods now.  Can still be re-enabled client side) "
 	,"1.8.0":"Uncrafting Grinder: Config blacklists moved from blocks category to modpacks (so no longer visible with ingame config gui);  blacklists now correctly use the modid:itemname string for vanilla and modded items; You can now blacklist an entire modid from the uncrafter.  Also no longer uncrafts enchanted items, or unenchanted items using a recipe that creates an enchanted one (Fixes the progressive automation/nether star exploit);  recipe slightly changed, 3 obsidian instead of 1;  Harvester: processing time now in config file.  Nether and End ores now have correct mining levels set (so no longer can you mine nether diamond ore with a wooden pickaxe for example).  Auto fisher now respects mending enchantment to repair fishing rods with fished exp (it already worked with luck and unbreaking and others before).  Autofisher now runs every second instead of every tick (default speed is still the same at 7% chance to catch).  Autofisher speed in config file."
  	,"1.8.1":"Fix Uncrafting Grinder BlacklistOutput not working.  Fix Cyclic machines losing their data (items, etc) when their block state gets changed (when they get rotated by some modded item).  Fix Prospector tool not detected modded ores: It now lists out every block found and its count, not just ores."
 	,"1.8.2":"Both Harvester and Garden Scythe now consume one seed from the block drops while replanting.  Cyclic Scepter: add config toggle to turn off the purple particle beam on use.  Fix Cyclic Scepter claiming to be empty and not building when actually only the first two slots were empty and others had blocks.  Redstone carrots now increase horse speed by 1% each, down from 5%.  Ender carrots now increase horse jump height by 1% each, down from 2%.  Magic Bean now grows with bonemeal.  Add config option in items category for saddles horse armor, and records to stack to 16.  "
  	,"1.8.3":"Harvester and Block Miner now have a GUI screen.  All cyclic machines that required redstone now have a redstone toggle button in their GUI: This allows you to change between two modes: Always On and Requires redstone.  Increased mining efficiency of Block Miner.  Removed the recently added stacksize 16 for records: Vanilla jukeboxes are buggy and can't handle this, causes item duplication."
  	,"1.8.4":"Fix Auto Fisher sometimes crashing when the fishing rod is empty or does not have mending.  "
  	,"1.8.5":"Harvester GUI now has two new buttons: You can change the harvest area as well as preview it.  The Harvester size is no longer in the config file.  All machine block models face the same direction in your inventory now.  New Item: Stirrups.  Add missing config for existing feature: 'F3SpawnChunkInfo' for Within Spawn or Distance from spawn chunk text on F3 menu.  Add missing config for existing feature 'F3HorseInfo'.  Fix Sack of Storage merging items with different NBT data.  Added zh_CN.lang.  Rebalanced some early game trades on Sage and Druid villagers, and added new trades at the end (new spawns not existing). "
  	,"1.8.6":"Fix Tree Scythe and Brush Scythe not working.  Fix Magic Bean not dropping its seed when at full growth.  Increased recipe output of many of the Ender projectiles.  "
  	,"1.8.7":"Added shearing block.  Added torch launcher.  Cyclic Building Scepter given a more descriptive name.   Some tool recipes changed to use quartz instead of ghast tears: Piston Scepter, Cyclic Building Scepter.  Fix Structure Builder placing leaves that decay right away.  Structure Builder and Cyclic Build Scepter now play the block place sounds as they build.  Fix Auto Torch attempting to place in liquids.  Tweaked & cleaned up a few item textures.  New Recipe and JSON Models for the Randomizer and the Exchange Scepters."
  	,"1.8.8":"Fix Uncrafting grinder bug when trying to insert into Refined Storage Interface block.  Fix Uncrafting Grinder sometimes merging items with different NBT data.  ProspectorRange now has default config value of 32 instead of 16 (doesn't affect existing config files).  Stop the thrown torches (from Ender Torch or Torch Launcher) land on non-solid surfaces (such as on leaves or flowers).  Add missing sound effect to torch launcher.  "
  	,"1.8.9":"Fix compatibility with commands and HelperFixer (compareTo issues from server logs & possible crashes running /help).  Horse upgrade carrots for speed and jump now increase at a constant rate and not a percentage; this also fix incorrect upgrading while the horse is under jump or speed potions.  "
 	,"1.8.10":"Fix the Cyclic scepter crashing the client when trying to place a block on empty space at max range and failing to play a sound effect"
  	,"1.8.11":"New Item: Ender Sack.  New Block: Interdiction Plate.  "
  	,"1.8.12":"Uncrafting Grinder GUI overhaul: New help button to identify if an item can be uncrafted, and if not it gives a reason.  It no longer tries to deposit items into containers (was incompatible with some containers, and occasionally had issues), instead has its own inventory of recipe output, which can be extracted by hoppers and pipes.  Fix timeout & delay errors in Bucket storage.  "
  	,"1.8.13":"Automated User now works on entities.  New Items: Water Froster, Water Spreader, Water Splasher.  Fix sack of holding incompatibility with storage drawers, where you would sometimes get ConcurrentModification exceptions and have the emtpy sack go to negative stack sizes.  Fix Piston Scepter letting the offhand action trigger at the same time.   "
 	,"1.8.14":"Magic Bean: Now has config file entries to disable bonemeal, and disable dropping a bean (seed item) when fully grown.  Magic Bean loot table is now entirely in the config file (so you can remove items or add modded items).  New category mobs -> mobloottable so you can tweak the bonus item drop percentage on top of just the true/false.  The chance for cyclic items to spawn in dungeon chests is now in config as ChestLootChance and defaults to 4 (it used to be hardcoded as 7; still can be disabled by ChestLoot config as normal).  Removed Emerald Shovel and Axe from dungeon loot.  All Ender Projectiles now work out of a dispenser (Snow, Bombs, Blaze, Dungeon Finder, Fishing, Lightning, Torch, Water, Shears).  Updated some tooltips.  Controlled Miner is no longer fixed at 9x9, you can change the area that it mines.  Controlled Miner and Structure Builder now both have preview buttons.  Fixed the machines smoking when not running after chunk/world is reloaded.  Automated User can now toggle between two modes: Use and Attack.  "
	,"1.8.15":"Automatic Fishing Net: fixed a bug where it wasn't dropping contents when you break it.  Automatic Fishing Net now uses wood break/place sounds instead of stone.  "
  	,"1.9.0":"Updated to forge 12.18.3.2185.  Speed charm no longer gives the speed potion effect, it directly increases your speed without effects (so no particles, and it can stack with potions).  Implement PermissionAPI for compatibility with FTBUtilities.  Emerald gear is now on par with diamond instead of being weaker (still has enchantability of gold).   Nether Lapis spawn rate reduced by 1/3rd.  End and Nether ores can spawn veins as big as 8.  Nether Diamond and Emerald spawn rates reduced by 50%.  Slightly reduced spawn rate of End coal and End redstone ore.  Fix Button/text overlap in Automated User.  Removed several test messages that were spamming logs.  "
  	,"1.9.1":"Fix a crash that can happen when unbinding keys.  Ender Book experience cost config now allows value zero.  Cyclic Building Scepter is now compatible with blocks from Chisel and Bits blocks.  "
  	,"1.9.2":"New block: Fan.  Auto Fisher: Fixed not outputting items to things like hoppers.  Added a tooltip for Autofisher.  Fix tooltip on exchange scepter.  "
  	,"1.9.3":"Added recipe for Fan.  "
  	,"1.9.4":"Fix crash caused by certain types of modded armor in the Uncrafting grinder (such as bronze armor from IC2).  Auto fisher will now refuse to fish if a non-fishing rod item ends up in that slot.  Vein size and spawn chances of Nether ore and End ore now in config; tweak or disable each individually.  "
  	,"1.9.5":"New Block: Pattern Replicator.  Add config for disabling Viscous potion.  Fix speed charm exploit bug.  Speed charm now has more durability, but takes damage a bit faster, and costs emerald blocks instead of emerald items to craft and repair.  Added new mob spawn config to allow pigmen to spawn naturally in Mesa biomes (off by default).  "
  	,"1.9.6":"Fix bug when hoppers or conduits are inserting items into Controlled Miner; it now safely inserts tools into the correct slots and ignores the rest without crashing.  "
  	,"1.9.7":"New Block: Entity Detector"
  	,"1.9.8":"Fix block miners constantly playing equip sounds for fake player.  Fix Automated User in attack mode not calculating damage from enchantments or modded items (such as tinkers swords)"
 	,"1.9.9":"Fix sign editing feature calling a client only function on servers (was causing log spam but not crashing or causing issues).  Fix inventory extension not saving when servers add prefixes to player names such as '[Owner]<'.  Config entry Build Scepter HUD replaced with Scepter HUD which now can be in all four corners.  Exchange scepters can now have their hud move to all four corners using the same Scepter HUD config.  Exchange scepters can now build out of the third row of the inventory (in addition to the other two).  Fix Harvester and Miner crashing when put on top of a hopper (even though they have no inventory slots).  Make sure each 'FakePlayer' from this mod uses a different UUID.  Fix model rendering glitch on Block Placer.  BlockPlacer now plays sounds as it places.  "
 	,"1.9.10":"Potions from cyclic now show potion level in the tooltip: for example Health Boost potion now shows Health Boost V.  Add support for JEI Description tabs on most items.  Automatic Fishing Net and Pattern Replicator no longer burn as furnace fuel.  New Blocks: slime conveyors now come in four total variants: fast, normal, slow, slowest.   Slime conveyors: now take up full space of the block (like a carpet) instead of partial (like a pressure plate) so entities dont have inconsistent speed at edges of a block.  Slime conveyors now keep the entity 'grounded' so they dont get sudden bursts of speed when going down a block onto a conveyor on a lower level(as seen in xisumavoids video with the sheep. can be reverted to old behavior in config->SlimeConveyorKeepEntityGrounded).  Slime conveyors now have an autocorrect feature that keep moving entities in the center of the path (can be disabled in config->blocks->SlimeConveyorPullCenter)"
  	,"1.9.11":"Add block highlight overlay to Exchange scepters.  Fix Exchange scepter breaking blocks that are unbreakable.  Add blacklist to exchange scepter, default starts with only obsidian (modded blocks are supported).  Made some mild nerfs to both Exchange Scepters (reasoning: meant to be building & decorating, not be overpowered mining tools): Durability from 5000 to 1000 uses; takes damage per block replaced not per use (so a 3x3 area will take away 9 durability from item); cooldown from 10 ticks to 30 ticks; and upped recipe cost.  Fix slowfall potion from Wing charm getting stuck at 0:00.  Accepted a submission to update zh_CH.lang.  "
	,"1.9.12":"Stop the Controlled Miner from mining with tools on air blocks; this stops it from constantly draining durability from Tinkers Construct tools.  "
  	,"1.9.13":"New Block added: Aerial Faith Plate.  "
  	,"1.9.14":"Added Swim Speed Potion.  Added Block Rotator (Similar to Piston Scepter but its cheaper and only one mode).  Added Air Charm: Lets you walk on air while sneaking.Fixed Ender Aura not working: It now correctly prevents ender pearl damage.  Ender Aura Potion now also prevents ALL suffocation damage.  Ender Aura Potion now makes Enderman drop more exp from the player kill (randomly 1-5 extra).  "
  	,"1.9.15":"Update zh_CN lang file.  Config fix: claySize was missing from ocean category"
  	,"1.9.16":"New Item: Climbing Gloves - use any vertical surface as a ladder.  "
  	,"1.9.17":"New Item: Rod of Elevation.  Teleport yourself or any target entity to the nearest surface above.  "
  	,"1.9.18":"Air Charm now helps prevent fall damage if you fall and then use it in midair.  Fix the Structure Builder sometimes placing ghost blocks.  Structure Builder now has new modes: Solid, Stairway, Sphere.  Fix an infrequent crash with Harvester when you break it while its still running and about to harvest.  "
  	,"1.9.19":"Fix a crash caused by Cyclic when throwing an ender pearl while riding a mount (feature causing this is config>player>PearlsOnHorseback). "
  	,"1.10.0":"Machines now have animations when running.  A few items have new names, recipes, or textures.  Auto fisher now requires any four of the six faces to be wet, but it can be any sides so automation is easier.  Auto fisher now displays frequency in GUI, which is fishing speed based on nearby water.  Auto Fisher will no longer let enchanted fishing rods break, it drops them with 1 point left."
  	,"1.10.1":"Uncrafting grinder has two new error types for the ? button, one for if something is enchanted, and the other if the recipe type is unknown and not supported.  "
	,"1.10.2":"New Item: Redstone Lever, bind this to a lever in the world and then operate it remotely.  Added a few missing tooltips on other items. "
  	,"1.10.3":"Most item rendering rotation changed to match vanilla items (Thanks Frost2779).  Scaffolding block changes: renamed to Fragile Scaffolding, slowed down rate of decay, and recipe output increased.  New Block: Reactive Scaffolding that auto breaks when its neighbour breaks.  New Block: Replaceable Scaffolding: building on it replaces it instead of normal placement.  Reduced sound of scaffolding blocks.  Scaffolding blocks are climb-able like a ladder.  Scaffolding blocks can be built at long range: build while sneaking and it builds a block on the far opposite side, so you can easily build bridges or towers.  Fixed scaffolding transparency (it no longer kills grass).  "
  	,"1.10.4":"Fix a mod compatibility / item duplication glitch with a block from cyclic and the Drill from Actually Additions.  A few more updates for block item-model rotation.  "
  	,"1.10.5":"Item Magnet now can be shut off by giving it redstone power.  New Items: Glowing Chorus Fruit; Darksight Helmet; Nokozan Chestplate; Leggings of Zakarum; Boots of Elitch.  "
  	,"1.10.6":"Password Detector: when this block is triggered from the password in chat, it blocks the message from going to all players and instead sends you a single message.  Add missing config entry for Glowing chorus fruit.  Glowing chorus no longer gives nausea, and takes glowstone dust to craft instead of blocks.  Glowing chorus now gives flying for 10 seconds, up from 7.  Corrected some tooltips.  "
  	,"1.10.7":"Added Mattock: Mines dirt and stone in a 3x3 area.  Heart Container will now block you from eating it when you are full on hearts.  Fix Automated User letting item stacks go into negative numbers when using on multiple entities.

Filled sack now attempts to find the translated name of the contained tile entity, instead of the text 'tile.whatever'.  Items added to random chest loot: Rod of Elevation, Climbing Gloves, Air Charm.  "
